### The entry point to the Segura Ecosystem

This repository introduces the **public-facing components** that surround, support, or demonstrate concepts adjacent to the private Finovia protocol.

Finovia itself remains private — the protocol logic, incentive engine, settlement model, and internal flows are not exposed.  
This repo simply helps visitors understand how the **public ecosystem** fits together.

## 🔒 About Finovia

Finovia is a private protocol-level economic engine.  
Only the **conceptual overview** is public — the implementation remains private and proprietary.

Public repos in this ecosystem demonstrate:

- modular backend architecture  
- execution and state transitions  
- automation pipelines  
- operator-first UI/UX  
- browser automation  
- conceptual protocol design
