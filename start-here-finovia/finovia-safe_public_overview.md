# Finovia (Public-Safe Overview)

Finovia is a private protocol‑level economic engine focused on incentives, flows, and value movement.  
Only the *conceptual overview* is public — the implementation, logic, and internal architecture remain private.

Finovia explores:

- how value is created and distributed  
- how incentives shape system behavior  
- how settlement flows can be automated  
- how operators interact with economic systems  
- how modular components form a coherent engine  

The public ecosystem (execution engine, pipelines, automation, UI mock, router tree) demonstrates patterns and ideas **adjacent** to Finovia without revealing the protocol itself.

Finovia remains private, proprietary, and under active development.
